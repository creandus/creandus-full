	* bash/add.bash.in, bash/addgroup.bash.in, bash/adduser.bash.in,
	bash/cleanup.bash.in, bash/db.bash.in, bash/delgroup.bash.in,
	bash/deluser.bash.in, bash/install_fail.bash.in: Make sure that
	failure to source any of our helper functions' scripts is fatal. Also,
	make sure we die if calls to {user,group}{add,mod,del} functions fail.

2006-08-10  Mike Kelly  <pioto@pioto.org>

	* bash/add.bash.in, bash/addgroup.bash.in, bash/adduser.bash.in,
	bash/cleanup.bash.in, bash/db.bash.in, bash/delgroup.bash.in,
	bash/deluser.bash.in, bash/install_fail.bash.in: Cleaned up all our
	main scripts. We now keep everything local that should be, use proper
	capitalization, etc.

	* bash/common/read_groupdata.bash.in,
	bash/common/read_userdata.bash.in: Updated the data parsing scripts.
	They now echo out bash code, meant to be exec'd within the calling
	function. Note: all vars returned are scoped "local", meaning that
	these functions *MUST* be called from within another function.

	* configure.ac: "Modernized" our autotools stuff. We now use the
	new-style syntax in here, defining a bug report email address, etc.
	Removed one spurious macro (AUTHREADME).

	* tools/run_test.bash, tools/subst.bash: Minor cleanup.

	* doc/API.txt: Fix a typo.

2006-08-10  Mike Kelly  <pioto@pioto.org>

	* Makefile.am, bash/Makefile.am, bash/auth/Makefile.am,
	bash/common/Makefile.am, eselect/Makefile.am: Clean up our
	Makefile.am's, make use of foreach to make things much tidier.

2006-08-08  Mike Kelly  <pioto@pioto.org>

	* doc/API.txt, doc/API_flowchart.dia, doc/API_flowchart.png,
	doc/API_flowchart2.dia,	doc/API_flowchart2.png: Update API
	documentation to reflect the addition of cleanup.bash. Now, all three
	points of interaction with the package manager take the same
	arguments.

2006-08-08  Mike Kelly  <pioto@pioto.org>

	* bash/cleanup.bash.in: Add a cleanup script, to be called to do all
	the proper database cleanup, etc, after a successful
	re-build/un-install.

2006-08-06  Mike Kelly  <pioto@pioto.org>

	* eselect/users.eselect.in: Add support to the eselect module's scan
	mode to simply chown the files belonging to a found user or group to
	0:0 (root), rather than removing them.

	* doc/API.txt, doc/API_flowchart.dia, doc/API_flowchart.png,
	doc/API_flowchart2.dia, doc/API_flowchart2.png: Add flowcharts of the
	install and uninstall process to the API documentation.

2006-08-04  Mike Kelly  <pioto@pioto.org>

	* doc/auth_modules.txt: Add documentation of the auth module format.

2006-08-03  Mike Kelly  <pioto@pioto.org>

	* tools/get_autoconf_macros.sed: _'s are legal in variable names, too.

	* tools/subst.bash: Make the seds a little less harsh. Figured the
	only real way to get this stuff right is to source the confvars file
	several times in a row... But this seems bad...

2006-08-03  Mike Kelly  <pioto@pioto.org>

	* tools/get_autoconf_macros.sed, tools/subst.bash: Add a script,
	subst.bash, which will, given a file with @foo@ style autoconf
	substition markers, replace them. The difference between this and just
	using ./configure to do the job is that it'll fully evaluate any shell
	variables before substituting them, removing the need to do things
	like prefix=@prefix@ before the variable you actually care about.

2006-08-02  Mike Kelly  <pioto@pioto.org>

	* doc/API.txt: Clean up the API spec some more.

2006-08-01  Mike Kelly  <pioto@pioto.org>

	* (Everything): Begin a big 'ol rewrite of stuff, putting most code
	inside functions. This allows for variables to be kept out of the
	global scope, and also allows for easy, automatic syntax checks. Added
	some basic tests to Makefiles.

2006-07-31  Mike Kelly  <pioto@pioto.org>

	* bash/add.bash.in, bash/install_fail.bash.in: We shouldn't fail if
	ENEWUSERS or ENEWGROUPS are empty.

	* Makefile.am: Put a .keep file in the dbdirs, so they always exist
	properly.

2006-07-31  Mike Kelly  <pioto@pioto.org>

	+ Release: 0.3.1

	* Makefile.am: Add doc to EXTRA_DIST, so we actually distribute our
	documentation.

2006-07-31  Mike Kelly  <pioto@pioto.org>

	+ Release: 0.3.0

2006-07-31  Mike Kelly  <pioto@pioto.org>

	* (Everything): Switch everything to explicitly use bash. Rename all
	scripts from .sh to .bash, use #!/bin/bash, etc.

2006-07-31  Mike Kelly  <pioto@pioto.org>

	* eselect/users.eselect.in: Fix some load_config lines, remove an
	unnecessary one.

2006-07-31  Mike Kelly  <pioto@pioto.org>

	* -API, doc/API.txt, doc/Makefile: RST-ize the API specifications.
	Provide a Makefile for them.

2006-07-30  Mike Kelly  <pioto@pioto.org>

	* bash/delgroup.sh.in, bash/deluser.sh.in,
	bash/auth/{compat,files}-{GNU-glibc,BSD-FreeBSD}-{user,group}del.sh,
	bash/install_fail.sh.in, eselect/users.eselect.in: Add new user and
	group deletion scripts, which are called by the eselect script, and by
	the install_fail.sh.

2006-07-30  Mike Kelly  <pioto@pioto.org>

	* eselect/users.eselect.in: More improvements from Kugelfang and
	ciaranm on IRC.

2006-07-30  Mike Kelly  <pioto@pioto.org>

	* eselect/users.eselect.in: Improve the eselect module, per advice from
	Kugelfang. Should now respect ROOT and have better style.

2006-07-29  Mike Kelly  <pioto@pioto.org>

	* bash/db.sh.in: Fix a typo, line 21,22 (missing \).

2006-07-28  Mike Kelly  <pioto@pioto.org>

	+ Release: 0.2.0

2006-07-27  Mike Kelly  <pioto@pioto.org>

	* bash/install_fail.sh.in: Add the install_fail script, which is
	called by the package manager when an install fails. It rolls back
	anything which may have been done by the add script.

	* bash/add.sh.in, bash/db.sh.in, bash/addgroup.sh.in,
	bash/adduser.sh.in: Add stub ROOT parameter. Not yet really
	implemented anywhere, but it's part of the API.

	* API: Create a writeup of the API specs for dynusers.

2006-07-26  Mike Kelly  <pioto@pioto.org>

	* bash/auth/compat-{BSD-FreeBSD,GNU-glibc}-{user,group}del.sh,
	bash/auth/files-GNU-glibc-{user-group}del.sh: Create user/group
	deletion helper scripts.

	* bash/add.sh.in: Create a wrapper script which eats full
	ENEW{USER,GROUP}S for breakfast and does what it's supposed to do.
	Let's call this part of the dynusers "API".

2006-07-24  Mike Kelly  <pioto@pioto.org>

	* bash/db.sh.in: Create a script for accessing the user 
	database, so that external things don't need to know the 
	implementation-specifics.

	* Makefile.am, bash/addgroup.sh.in, bash/adduser.sh.in,
	eselect/users.eselect.in: Drop the s from the user and group DBDIR
	subdirs.

2006-07-20  Mike Kelly  <pioto@pioto.org>

	+ Release: 0.1.3
	
	* bash/auth/: Change naming scheme to ${USERLAND}-${ELIBC}
	instead of simply ${USERLAND}. Add BSD auth modules.

2006-07-19  Mike Kelly  <pioto@pioto.org>

	* eselect/users.eselect.in: Fix eselect module to use proper DBDIR,
	etc. by sourcing $scriptdir/common/config.sh.

2006-07-18  Mike Kelly  <pioto@pioto.org>

	+ Release: 0.1.2

2006-07-15  Mike Kelly  <pioto@pioto.org>

	+ Release: 0.1.1

2006-07-10  Mike Kelly  <pioto@pioto.org>

	+ Release: 0.1.0
