This is just a testing version. It is FAR from ready for production use. 
Feel free to send me some test cases to run everything through, though.

This is a summary of what has changed between released versions. More detailed
information may be found in the ChangeLog.

0.4.2:
    New Features:
    - Major code cleanup all around.
    - Smoother build system.

0.4.1:
    Bug Fixes:
    - Fix a bug that caused all the scripts to fail if anything was found in
      NSSWITCH_CONF, due to my misunderstanding of bash's source command...

0.4.0:
    New Features:
    - doc/ - Thorough documentation of the dynusers API, and of the format of
      auth modules and the user/group data files.
    - Tests - all the backend scripts now get basic syntax checking during make
      check. Some also have more thorough tests of correctness.
    - tools/ - script "compiler" written. Allows for much cleaner Makefile.am's
      and configure.ac.
