High Priority:

 Add backend scripts for other systems, e.g. gentoo-fbsd.

 Create some test cases.

 Integrate with package managers (e.g. portage, paludis, etc).

Medium Priority:

 bash/common/read{user,group}data.sh:
   Build {USER,GROUP}FILE dynamically based upon the currently selected
   profile.

 bash/common/config.sh:
   Make these nsswitch.conf parsing regexps better, more general.

 bash/adduser.sh:
   Check that the user is in all the proper groups (line 64).

Low Priority:

 bash/add{user,group}.sh:
   Allow for more sophisticated range specifications for UID/GIDs.

   If there needs to be some change made, note it properly, for the
   operator to take care of later with the eselect tool. Right now the
   modification is done automatically.

 bash/common/read{user,group}data.sh:
   Split this file up in such a way as to be automatically done
   correctly for various distros.
