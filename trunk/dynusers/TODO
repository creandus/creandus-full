High Priority:

 Nothing.

Medium Priority:

 bash/common/read{user,group}data.bash:
   Build {USER,GROUP}FILE dynamically based upon the currently selected
   profile.

 Create some more test cases.

Low Priority:

 Add backend scripts for other systems, e.g. gentoo-obsd.

 bash/add{user,group}.bash:
   Allow for more sophisticated range specifications for UID/GIDs.

   If there needs to be some change made, note it properly, for the
   operator to take care of later with the eselect tool. Right now the
   modification is done automatically.

 bash/common/read{user,group}data.bash:
   Split these files up in such a way as to be automatically done
   correctly for various distros.
