Introduction
============

One of the main design features of dynusers is that it is easy to add in
additional modules for authentication systems in different operating systems.
This document defines the necessary features of any module.

Naming
======

Dynusers modules follow this naming scheme:

  *nss*-*userland*-*elibc*-*action*

  *nss*
    The name of the `Name Service Switch`_ module being used [#]_. Usually,
    this is either ``compat`` or ``files``, although it could also be something
    like ``ldap``. This is determined by the contents of your
    `/etc/nsswitch.conf`_ file. For example::

      # /etc/nsswitch.conf:

      passwd:   compat
      shadow:   compat
      group:    compat

      # passwd: db files nis
      # shadow: db files nis
      # group:  db files nis

.. _Name Service Switch: http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Name-Service-Switch.html

.. _/etc/nsswitch.conf: http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/NSS-Configuration-File.html

.. [#] NSS exists on most GNU, BSD, and Solaris systems, but not on Darwin (Mac
   OS X) systems. For consistency, if the nsswitch.conf file cannot be found,
   this value should be assumed to be ``compat``.

..

  *userland*
    The userland is the general style of unix utilities provided in the system,
    *e.g.* "GNU", "BSD", or "Darwin"[#]_.

.. [#] Darwin is the underlying userland for Mac OS X.

..

  *elibc*
    Similar to *userland*, this specifies the libc implementation. This is how
    various flavors of BSD, for example, are distinguished. Some samples:
    "glibc" (for GNU/Linux), "FreeBSD", "OpenBSD", "NetBSD", "Darwin".

  *action*
    The action to be performed. This is one of "useradd", "usermod", "userdel",
    "groupadd", "groupmod", or "groupdel".
