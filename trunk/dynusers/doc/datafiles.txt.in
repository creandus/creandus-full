Introduction
============

One of the main points of dynusers is to provide an easy way for package
maintainers to manage the users and groups their packages need. This is done
by creating the proper *data files*. This document describes their format, and
provides some examples.

Specifications
==============

All the description files follow a simple format. Lines beginning with a hash
mark ("#"), or blank lines are comments. Other lines are of the format::

  key: value

When looking for the data for a user, first the file
``${DATADIR}/user/${USERNAME}`` is checked, where *DATADIR* is the location of
the top-level data tree and USERNAME is the name of the user being searched for.
Any keys which are not specified in this file will then be looked up in the
top-level file, ``${DATADIR}/accounts``, which contains all the default values
for the keys.

Users
-----

The users files contain the following keys: 

  uid
    The range specification for the numeric group id of the group. A range
    specification consists of a lower and upper bound, like ``25-35``, or of a
    single number, like ``1234``. Dynusers will use the first available number
    in that range. If none in that range are available, it will exit with
    failure.

  shell
    The default shell for the user. It would often be best to not specify this,
    so that dynusers will use the proper default for your profile.

  home
    The home directory for the user. As with shell, it is sometimes best to not
    specify this unless specifically needed, and to instead let dynusers use the
    profile's defaults.

  groups
    A comma-separated list of groups this user should belong to, with the first
    listed group being its default group.

  comment
    The GECOS comment field for the user. Should be something like "user for
    running misc-apps/foo-server" (quotes unnecessary).

Groups
------

The groups files contain only one key:

  gid
    The range specification for the numeric group id of the group. As with *uid*
    above, a range specification consists of a lower and upper bound, like
    ``25-35``, or of a single number, like ``1234``. Dynusers will use the first
    available number in that range. If none in that range are available, it will
    exit with failure.

Examples
========

This is a sample users data file, for the user "foo"::

  # A sample user config file, for user "foo"
  uid: 1234-1250
  #shell: unspecified
  home: /var/empty
  groups: foo
  comment: foo's user

Since the shell field is unspecified, the scripts will instead use a
less-specific default (for now, that would just be the default file,
``accounts``, although if this data gets placed into the portage tree, it will
become part of the cascading profiles).

And here is a sample file for foo's group, "foo"::

  # A sample group config file, for group "foo"
  gid: 1234

Finally, here is a sample ``accounts`` file, which contains the default values::

  # Default account settings for the glep27-user/group tools
  uid: 1-999
  shell: /bin/false
  home: /dev/null
  groups: 
  comment: user created by portage
  gid: 1-999
